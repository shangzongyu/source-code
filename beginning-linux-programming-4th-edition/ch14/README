Semaphores, Message Queues and Shared Memory.


sem1.c  - a semaphore program implementing a simple binary semaphore interface.

shm1.c, shm2.c - two programs that cooperate over the use of shared memory.

msg1.c, msg2.c - two programs that send messages between between each other (from msg2.c to msg1.c).


CD Application.

This is the same as in the previous chapter, except:

app/ipc_imp.c - a file that replaces pipe_imp.c

app/Makefile - an new version to take account of this change.
